# PocketSmith OpenAPI 3 documentation

We've documented our public API using the OpenAPI 3 specification, available in the `openapi.json` file.

Using this documentation, you're able to do things like bootstrap an API client easily in your language of choice. We also use it for our API explorer at <https://developers.pocketsmith.com>.
